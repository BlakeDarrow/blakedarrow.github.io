                    <p>
                    Not only do I go to bed way too late, sleep in and feel tired throughout the day; my body feels overwhelmed and at the point of breaking. This typically happens because I consistently fall for going to “bed” only to get on my phone and watch YouYube for multiple hours. This is a problem that has many layers and causes issues in all aspects of my life

                        <p>
                        My entire adult life I have struggled with keeping a sleeping schedule. This has caused me physical, emotional, and spiritual harm. I think it is long overdue to try and solve this. I have tried simply going to bed earlier but that doesn't seem to work. 
                        </p>
                    
                        <p>
                        I plan on waking up at 7:00 am every weekday morning to go to the gym and start my day off right. This will have a compounding effect and force me to go to bed earlier, get off my phone at night, eat healthier, and get more done in the day. This time I am approaching the angle a little differently. By forcing myself to wake up at 7:00 am and go to the gym, I am hoping this multifaceted problem will work itself out. Additionally, sense I have not done this before, my roommate will be both my accountability and my gym partner.

                                Waking up early has been truly wonderful. At first, I hated it, but over the weeks I have started to enjoy it. It has forced me to be in bed at 11:00 pm and go to sleep at a reasonable time. The gym takes around an hour, and then including a shower and breakfast, I'm ready to go around 8:30-8:45. This has left me with so much more time and energy both in the morning and throughout the day. Additionally, my days feel much longer because I am not sleeping it away, and I am certainly feeling physically better and healthier. I thought this experiment would be more about trying to get disciplined and go to the gym, but it has shown me a new light on the importance of good rest.

                    During this experiment I have discovered that even knowing I have to get up early, I will stay up late watching YouTube only to hurt future me. This has made me more aware of both my phone problem and my sleeping problem. However, forcing myself to wake up early regardless of how tired I am, has been incredibly beneficial. I have discovered the benefits of being “a morning person” and why so many people wake up early and go to the gym.
